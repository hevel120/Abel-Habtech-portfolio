        <center> <h1> <q>History of HTML </q></h1></center><hr>
        <p> The first version of HTML was written by <b>Tim Berners lee in 1993</b>. <br> <hr>
        Since then , there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout
          2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.</p>

          <p> Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML languge.</p>
          <p>XML is a standard markup languge that is used to creat other <i>markup languge</i>.</p>
          <p> Hundereds of XML languges are in use today, including GML( geogeraph markup languge),MathML,
            MUSICL, and RSS(Relly simple syndication).</p>
            <div style="color: green;">
                <p>Since each of these languges was written in a commen languge (XML), their content can easily 
                    be shared across applications.</p>
                <p>This makes XML potentially very powerful. and  it is no surprise that the W3C would creat an 
                    XML version of HTML (agian called XHTML).</p>    
            </div>

            <p style="color: orange;">XML become an official standared in 2000, and was updated in 2002.XHTML is very similar to HTML,
             but ha stricter rule.</p>
            <p style="color: red;"> Strict rules are nessessary for all XML languges, becouse without it,interoperability 
            between applications would be impossible.</p>
